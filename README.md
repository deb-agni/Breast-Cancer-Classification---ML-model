# Breast-Cancer-Classification---ML-model
This machine learning-based project model for breast cancer classification helps predict the type of cancer(Benign or Malignant). After you provide the proper information, the model will classify the type of breast cancer. The Model's accuracy is around 97%, and its precision rate is between 98% and 99%.

## Overview
This project demonstrates the following:
- Data preprocessing, including handling missing values and feature scaling.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify trends and relationships within the dataset.
- Implementation and evaluation of machine learning models.

The goal is to help medical professionals identify breast cancer cases efficiently.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is from [source/link]. It includes features such as:
- Mean radius, texture, and perimeter.
- Diagnosis labels: `benign` and `malignant`.

Make sure to download the dataset and place it in the appropriate directory if not already included.

## Requirements
To run the notebook, you need to install the following:

- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries:
  ```bash
  pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
  ```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Breast_Cancer_Classification.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Breast_Cancer_Classification
   ```

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Breast_cancer_classification.ipynb
   ```

4. Run the cells step-by-step to:
   - Load the dataset
   - Preprocess data
   - Train and evaluate models

## Results
The notebook evaluates models based on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. It includes visualizations for better interpretability of the results.
